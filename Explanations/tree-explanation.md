Explanation: We implement the insert and search methods recursively. Each node has left and right children, corresponding to lesser and greater values, respectively.

Exercise: Find the Height of a Binary Tree
Problem: Calculate the height of a given binary tree.

Objective: Write a C# method that returns the height of a binary tree.

Hint: The height of a tree is the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. 
You can solve this recursively by comparing the height of the left and right subtrees.

Conclusion
Trees are powerful structures that allow you to represent and manage data hierarchically, providing efficient operations for search and modification.
