Explanation: We push each character of the input string onto the stack and then pop them off, which reverses the order.

Exercise: Balanced Parentheses
Problem: Check if an expression has balanced parentheses using a stack.

Objective: Write a C# method that returns true if the parentheses in the input string are balanced and false otherwise.

Hint: When you encounter an opening parenthesis, push it onto the stack. 
When you see a closing one, pop from the stack and check if the pairs match. 
If the stack is empty at the end, the parentheses are balanced.

Conclusion
Stacks are a versatile data structure that can simplify various tasks, especially those involving reversal or maintaining order in a LIFO manner.
